### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned about the different tax brackets when filing taxes and the difficulty of having to methodically change the values for each tax bracket but still maintain the correct formula.)
2. (I already learned about the getElementById method but I finally realized the purpose of it is basically to place it where you'd like in the webpage.)
3. (I have solidified my knowledge on the clear button method which is basically used to reset the program so you can use it again.)
